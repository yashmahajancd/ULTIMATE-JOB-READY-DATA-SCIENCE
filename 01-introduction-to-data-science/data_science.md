## What is Data Science?

*Data Science* is the process of *collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data* to make informed decisions.

It combines:
- Mathematics & Statistics
- Programming
- Domain knowledge
- Problem-solving mindset

Rather than being purely theoretical, Data Science focuses on *solving real-world problems using data*.

## Why is Data Science Important?

Data is generated everywhere — social media, apps, sensors, businesses.  
Organizations use Data Science to:

- Make better business decisions
- Predict future outcomes
- Automate complex processes
- Personalize user experiences

### Real-world examples:
- *Healthcare:* Disease prediction & diagnosis
- *E-commerce:* Product recommendations
- *Finance:* Fraud detection
- *Entertainment:* Netflix / YouTube recommendations

## Key Steps in Data Science

A typical data science workflow involves:

1. Collecting data
2. Cleaning and preprocessing
3. Analyzing patterns
4. Building predictive models
5. Communicating insights

> ⚠️ Data cleaning alone can take *~80% of a data scientist’s time*.

## Data Science Lifecycle

The Data Science Lifecycle is a structured and iterative process:

### 1. Problem Definition
- Understand the business problem
- Define objectives and success metrics

### 2. Data Collection
- Gather data from databases, APIs, web scraping, or external sources

### 3. Data Cleaning (Preprocessing)
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Fix inconsistencies

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze distributions
- Visualize patterns
- Identify correlations and outliers

### 5. Model Building
- Apply machine learning algorithms
- Train models on historical data

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Measure performance using metrics  
  (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, RMSE, etc.)

### 7. Deployment
- Integrate models into real systems
- Use APIs or web applications

### 8. Communication & Reporting
- Present insights clearly to stakeholders
- Create dashboards and reports

### 9. Maintenance & Iteration
- Monitor model performance
- Retrain models with new data
