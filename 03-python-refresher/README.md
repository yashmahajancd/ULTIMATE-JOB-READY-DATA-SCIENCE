# Python Refresher for Data Science

This document provides a *concise refresher of Python fundamentals* required for Data Science and Machine Learning.  
The focus is on *practical usage*, clean syntax, and concepts that are heavily used in real-world data workflows.

## Why Python for Data Science?

Python is the preferred language in Data Science because it:
- Is easy to read and write
- Has a massive ecosystem of data libraries
- Supports rapid experimentation
- Scales from simple scripts to large ML pipelines

A strong Python foundation is essential before moving to NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning.

## Core Python Concepts

### Variables & Data Types
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Common data types: int, float, str, bool
- Type checking using type()
- Type conversion using int(), float(), str()

---

### Strings
- String immutability
- Indexing & slicing
- Common string methods
- Formatting using *f-strings* (preferred in modern Python)

---

### Operators
- Arithmetic & comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Membership & identity operators
- Operator precedence

---

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements
- if, elif, else
- Nested conditions
- Decision making based on data values

---

### Loops
- for loops with range()
- while loops
- Loop control: break, continue, pass

Loops are heavily used in:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Iterative experiments

---

## Python Data Structures

### Lists
- Ordered & mutable
- Indexing, slicing, and common methods
- Used for storing sequences of data

---

### Tuples
- Ordered & immutable
- Faster and safer for fixed data
- Tuple unpacking

---

### Sets
- Unordered & unique elements
- Useful for removing duplicates
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)

---

### Dictionaries
- Key–value data structure
- Fast lookups
- Used extensively in data processing
- Dictionary comprehension

---

## Functions

- Defining reusable code blocks
- Parameters & return values
- Default and keyword arguments
- Writing clean and modular code

Functions form the backbone of:
- Data pipelines
- Feature engineering logic
- Model evaluation steps

---

## File Handling

- Reading and writing files
- File modes (r, w, a)
- Best practice using with statement
- Handling text and binary files

File handling is critical for working with:
- CSV files
- Logs
- Configuration files

---

## JSON Handling

- JSON as a data exchange format
- Reading & writing JSON files
- Converting Python objects to JSON and back

Widely used in APIs and data storage.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Class methods & static methods

OOP helps in:
- Writing scalable code
- Structuring ML projects
- Reusability and maintainability

---

## Pythonic Features

### List Comprehensions
- Cleaner and faster looping
- Conditional comprehensions
- Dictionary & set comprehensions

---

### Lambda Functions
- Anonymous functions
- Used with map(), filter(), reduce()
- Helpful for quick data transformations

---

## Learning Outcome

After this refresher:
- Python fundamentals are solid
- Code becomes cleaner and more readable
- Ready to work with NumPy, Pandas, and ML libraries
- Better understanding of real-world data workflows

---

## Summary

This Python refresher ensures a *strong foundation* required for Data Science.  
The focus is on *practical usage*, not just syntax, preparing for advanced topics ahead.
